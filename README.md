Task 7: Monitor System Resources Using Netdata

Objective
The objective of this task was to install and use **Netdata**, a lightweight monitoring tool, to visualize system and application performance metrics in real-time. This included monitoring CPU usage, memory usage, disk performance, and Docker container metrics.

Tools Used
- Netdata – A free, open-source real-time monitoring tool.
- Docker – Used to run Netdata as a container without manual installation.


Steps Followed
1. Verified that Docker was running to support the Netdata container.
2. Pulled and started the Netdata container, which automatically made the monitoring dashboard available.
3. Accessed the Netdata dashboard through a web browser to view real-time performance metrics.
4. Monitored CPU usage, memory consumption, disk input/output, and Docker container resource usage.
5. Explored the alerts section to identify any unusual performance issues or system warnings.
6. Navigated through different chart panels to observe how Netdata visualizes data in real-time.
7. Checked the internal log files of Netdata to understand how it stores access information, errors, and health status.
8. Captured a screenshot showing CPU, memory, disk, and Docker metrics for submission.



Outcome
Through this task, I learned:
- How to set up a real-time monitoring tool using Docker.
- How to visualize and interpret CPU, memory, disk, and container performance data.
- How to explore alerts and logs to troubleshoot performance issues.
- The importance of monitoring in maintaining healthy server and application performance.
